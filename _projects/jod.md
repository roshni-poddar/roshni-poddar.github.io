# Jod: Improving Communication in Mixed Hearing Groups

Jodâ€™s features were iteratively designed using a combination of findings from prior work examining accessibility barriers in current videoconferencing platforms and feedback received from the participants in the first user study session.

## Prior work
Three primary challenges faced by Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals when using existing videoconferencing platforms:

1. **Limited Layout Customization**: Current platforms offer minimal options for customizing layouts and often automatically adjust and distribute video thumbnails, making visual communication difficult.

2. **Communication Difficulties**: DHH individuals often struggle to capture the attention of others, and in mixed hearing videoconferencing scenarios, both hearing and DHH participants face challenges in remembering appropriate communication accommodations.

3. **Audio-Centric Design**: Existing platforms predominantly prioritize audio, overlooking the needs of sign language users.

## Key Features of Jod
Jod addresses these challenges with several essential features:

1. **Customizable Visual Layout**: Users can easily resize, add, remove, and reposition video tiles, captions, and screen share windows, providing a clutter-free visual experience.

2. **Preset Feedback Messages**: Users can conveniently send predefined feedback messages by hovering over a participant's video tile, promoting effective communication.

3. **Active Signer Identification**: Jod uses a Wizard of Oz method to identify the active signer.

4. **Accessibility Indicators**: Users can specify their participant type (Deaf, Hearing, or Interpreter) upon joining a call, denoted by colors, icons, and labels in the user interface.

5. **Enhanced Transcription**: Jod improves audio transcriptions and captions by including preset feedback messages, emoji reactions, and indicating when a DHH user begins or stops signing. Transcriptions also display the accessibility indicator of each participant.

6. **Gesture Recognition**: To enhance feedback options while muted, users can use four emoji-based gestures: clap, hand raise, okay, and thumbs-up, which can be enabled by clicking on "Enable Gestures" in the gesture control bar.

## User Study
Using Jod, we conducted six mixed hearing group sessions, with four held in person and two conducted remotely, with a total of 34 participants. This group comprised 18 d/Deaf or hard of hearing participants, 10 hearing participants, and six sign language interpreters.

Each study session lasted approximately 2.5 hours and included three DHH signers, one or two interpreters, two hearing individuals, and two hearing researchers. Our sessions followed a structured approach, commencing with a 10-minute Jod tutorial, followed by 30-minute task-based explorations to acquaint participants with Jod's features. We then encouraged unstructured conversations on topics like food and festivals, engaged in a modified version of the charades game to promote direct communication, and concluded with a presentation round incorporating screen sharing.

The study culminated in a focus group discussion aimed at comprehending participants' general perceptions of Jod, collecting detailed feedback on its key features, and gathering suggestions for potential future enhancements.

The study protocol maintained consistency across both remote and in-person sessions. During remote sessions, we conducted initial introductions, Jod onboarding, and focus group discussions on Zoom, while all other study-related activities took place on Jod.

### Some Findings
1. DHH participants chose to allocate significant visual space to the interpreter, while some opted to keep all participants on the screen, minimizing the visual presence of hearing participants. Others even removed hearing participants from their view. However, manually resizing video tiles proved time-consuming.

2. Interpreters adjusted the size of DHH participants' and researchers' video tiles, making them larger than others.

3. A valuable "started signing" message in captions and transcriptions helped interpreters and hearing participants identify signers. DHH participants used transcriptions to follow conversations and captions to verify interpretations or continue conversations when the interpreter wasn't available.

4. Concerning preset messages, a DHH participant appreciated their directness without causing distractions. However, participants noted two issues: notification messages required manual dismissal, and there was no acknowledgment of receipt.

### Design Recommendations
Based on the study's findings, the following design recommendations are proposed:

1. Provide quick layout options like one-click actions for adding/removing video tiles based on hearing ability, a revert button for layout changes, and dynamic templates to suit various conversation needs.

2. In future versions, make notifications less intrusive, allowing recipients to acknowledge them. Consider priority based on the communication context.

3. Videoconferencing platforms can improve user profiles by enabling users to add sign names through short self-recorded videos.

### Insights from In-Person Sessions
The in-person study sessions, especially the charades game, played a crucial role in fostering camaraderie among participants. It helped them get more comfortable with each other and encouraged direct communication. The focus group discussions allowed for productive conversations between hearing and DHH participants and provided valuable feedback on feature suggestions. I believe that the these sessions proved more effective than individual interviews would have been.

In conclusion, our heartfelt thanks go to the WinVinaya foundation for their invaluable support in conducting this study. I highly encourage you to support their mission of providing employment opportunities to people with disabilities. On a personal note, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Anant Mittal and Meghna Gupta for the first time during this research, and I was truly impressed by their passion, hard work, and kindness.
