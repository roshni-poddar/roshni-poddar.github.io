I am a research fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I work with [Dr. Manohar Swaminathan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/swmanohmicrosoft-com/) and [Dr. Mohit Jain](https://mohitjaindr.github.io/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and accessibility. 
At Microsoft Research, I enjoy co-designing and evaluating accessible solutions that enable learning through play ([Ludic Design for Accessibility](https://www.ludicdesign.org/)) for people with disabilities, with a focus on the Global South.


Broadly, I am interested in
<b>co-designing with communities with disabilities to build and evaluate systems</b> that promote <b>learning,
creativity, play, and mixed-ability collaboration</b>. I firmly believe that we need to consider the impact of factors such as race, stigma, socioeconomic
status, and infrastructure to conduct more inclusive accessibility research.

<!-- Broadly, my interest lies in systems that promote <b>learning, creativity, and play</b> and am looking forward to leverage advanced technologies like <b>generative AI</b> for this purpose.

<!-- During my PhD, I am excited to collaborate and co-design with diverse communities with disabilities to build and evaluate systems that acknowledge and incorporate the complexities of identity and environment.  -->



<!-- Current projects:
1. **SignIt!** - a sign language quiz app co-designed with the DHH community.
2. **SEEDS** - an educational experience delivery system for children with vision impairments.
3. **Jod** - a video conferencing tool to facilitate communication within mixed hearing ability groups. -->



<!-- Currently, my projects involve an Android app called SignIt! It is a sign language-based quiz platform, similar to Kahoot, co-designed with the DHH community. We conducted a mixed-method study with 20 DHH participants to understand the usability, gameplay behavior, social interaction, and learning aspects of the app.

Additionally, I have been working on a project called SEEDS to deliver diverse learning experiences, including quizzes, games, and interactive stories, to children with vision impairments. The goal is to enable them to independently enjoy these experiences either over a feature phone using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or in a classroom. -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
