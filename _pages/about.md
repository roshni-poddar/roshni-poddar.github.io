I am a research fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I work with [Dr. Manohar Swaminathan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/swmanohmicrosoft-com/), [Dr. Mohit Jain](https://mohitjaindr.github.io/), and [Dr. Pratyush Kumar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/pratykumar/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and accessibility. I am deeply passionate about building and evaluating accessible solutions to facilitate learning through play ([Ludic Design for Accessibility](https://www.ludicdesign.org/)) through a participatory approach, with a particular focus on the Global South. 

Current projects:
1. **SignIt!** - a sign language quiz app co-designed with the DHH community.
2. **SEEDS** - an educational experience delivery system for children with vision impairments.
3. **Jod** - a video conferencing tool to facilitate communication within mixed hearing ability groups.



<!-- Currently, my projects involve an Android app called SignIt! It is a sign language-based quiz platform, similar to Kahoot, co-designed with the DHH community. We conducted a mixed-method study with 20 DHH participants to understand the usability, gameplay behavior, social interaction, and learning aspects of the app.

Additionally, I have been working on a project called SEEDS to deliver diverse learning experiences, including quizzes, games, and interactive stories, to children with vision impairments. The goal is to enable them to independently enjoy these experiences either over a feature phone using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system or in a classroom. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
